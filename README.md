# splitHaloTag_FP_kinetics_fitting
R script for kinetic fitting of fluorescence polarization data and initial slope calculation for EC50 determination with individual replicate reporting.

### Overview
This repository contains the R-based pipeline used to analyze kinetic fluorescence polarization (FP) data. The script is designed to process raw plate reader data, perform automated outlier detection, and fit kinetic curves to determine initial reaction rates.

### Folder Structure
* **01_raw_data/**: Place your raw .xlsx TECAN kinetic files here.
* **02_plate_layouts/**: Place your corresponding layout .xlsx files here.
* **03_raw_plots/**: Quality control plots for raw kinetics generated by the script.
* **04_plots/**: Automatically generated PDF/PNG plots showing raw data and fits.
* **05_fitted_parameters/**: Final output files including `slopes.csv` with individual replicate values.
